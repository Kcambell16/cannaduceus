		<p>Persona 1: Mary Jane Verde</p>

		<p>Age: 27 Medical</p>

		<p>Condition: Cancer</p>

		<p>Profession: Kindergarden Teacher</p>

		<p>Attitude: Mild mannered teacher with a husband and three year old daughter.  She feels like her life just started and she's already staring death in the face.  Even in this she perseveers and tries to make the best of every day for her daughter.  She receives chemo therapy once a week and it really takes a toil on her.  She uses cannabis for relief and to help her nasuea and lack of appetite.  It also helps her sleep and have more energy to take care of her daughter.</p>
		<p>Technology: Uses an iPhone5s With LTE she's had for a while because she likes the simplicity, Dell laptop at home running windows 7, a LG smart tv that she uses to watch Netflix and her daughter plays the Nintendo Wii.</p>
		<p>Goal For Using Cannaduceus: Mary Jane needs to be able to use her smart phone to locate the nearest dispensary. Because she doesn't want to travel all over town searching when she is in pain.  She wants to find one close to her house and another close to work as her main ones.  She is hoping to use medical cannabus to help with the symptoms chemo therapy gives her and also increase her appetite so she is able to keep her strength and keep up with her active 3 year old.  </p>
		<p>Use Case: Mary usually does her chemo treatments at the doctors office close to her work near the uptown area of Albuquerque.  Today that office was closed so she had to go to a different doctor at their westside location off of Coors Blvd.  After a particular bad round of chemo therapy she can't stand it and needs to find a dispensary near her fast.  Because she hates the westside she very rarely crosses the Rio Grande to venture on that side of town and she has no idea what dispensaries are close.  She can feel the crippling nausea starting to take effect as she pulls out her iPhone5s and clicks on the Cannaduceus app icon.  This loads up the app and she sees the welcome screen.  Because she has used the app before and wants to collect her loyalty points for visiting a new dispensary.  After the welcome screen she clicks on the "find near me" button and a map appears with her current location and participating dispensaries near her.</p>
		<p>After seeing three dispensaries around the same distance away she clicks on the closest one, Pure Life.  After clicking it's location on the map she opens another page with the dispensaries logo, address, and user rating at the top of the screen.  Because it is only rated two out of five "leaves" she decides to read the user reviews.  They are continually given low ratings on quality and customer service.  She doesn't like what she reads so she clicks on the next closet on the map screen.  This brings up Organtica which is rated 5 out of 5 "leaves".  Great ratings and feedback about the staff and products make her feel confident in choosing to visit Organtica.</p>
		<p>As she pulls into the parking lot of the dispensary the app realizes it because of the built in GPS feature and brings up their current menu and pricing.  She has been to their eastside location several times so the app also brings up her profile in the loyalty section of the app.  It shows her accumulated points from her last visit and she is suprised to see she already has enough points for a free edible of her choice. She clicks to redeem them at the check out and a qr code is generated that the dispensary will scan to redeem her points.  She gets her medication and her new loyalty points added to her account. She sees them automatically drop for the free edible but then go back up 3 points for her purchase she made and the points for visiting another location of the same dispensary.</p>
		<p>User Story: As a user Mary Jane wants an app that is fast and easy to find and enjoy her favorite dispensaries.</p>
